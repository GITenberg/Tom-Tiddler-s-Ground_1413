<h1>TOM TIDDLER&rsquo;S GROUND</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;PICKING UP SOOT AND CINDERS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And why Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground?&rdquo; said the Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he scatters halfpence to Tramps and such-like,&rdquo;
returned the Landlord, &ldquo;and of course they pick &rsquo;em up.&nbsp;
And this being done on his own land (which it <i>is</i> his own land,
you observe, and were his family&rsquo;s before him), why it is but
regarding the halfpence as gold and silver, and turning the ownership
of the property a bit round your finger, and there you have the name
of the children&rsquo;s game complete.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s appropriate
too,&rdquo; said the Landlord, with his favourite action of stooping
a little, to look across the table out of window at vacancy, under the
window-blind which was half drawn down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leastwise it has
been so considered by many gentlemen which have partook of chops and
tea in the present humble parlour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Traveller was partaking of chops and tea in the present humble
parlour, and the Landlord&rsquo;s shot was fired obliquely at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you call him a Hermit?&rdquo; said the Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call him such,&rdquo; returned the Landlord, evading
personal responsibility; &ldquo;he is in general so considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> a Hermit?&rdquo; asked the Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; repeated the Landlord, drawing his hand
across his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Landlord stooped again, to get a more comprehensive view of vacancy
under the window-blind, and&mdash;with an asphyxiated appearance on
him as one unaccustomed to definition&mdash;made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I suppose it to be,&rdquo; said the
Traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;An abominably dirty thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mopes is dirty, it cannot be denied,&rdquo; said the Landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intolerably conceited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mopes is vain of the life he leads, some do say,&rdquo;
replied the Landlord, as another concession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slothful, unsavoury, nasty reversal of the laws of human
mature,&rdquo; said the Traveller; &ldquo;and for the sake of GOD&rsquo;S
working world and its wholesomeness, both moral and physical, I would
put the thing on the treadmill (if I had my way) wherever I found it;
whether on a pillar, or in a hole; whether on Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground,
or the Pope of Rome&rsquo;s ground, or a Hindoo fakeer&rsquo;s ground,
or any other ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about putting Mr. Mopes on the treadmill,&rdquo;
said the Landlord, shaking his head very seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
ain&rsquo;t a doubt but what he has got landed property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far may it be to this said Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground?&rdquo;
asked the Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it at five mile,&rdquo; returned the Landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; When I have done my breakfast,&rdquo; said the
Traveller, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go there.&nbsp; I came over here this morning,
to find it out and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many does,&rdquo; observed the Landlord.</p>
<p>The conversation passed, in the Midsummer weather of no remote year
of grace, down among the pleasant dales and trout-streams of a green
English county.&nbsp; No matter what county.&nbsp; Enough that you may
hunt there, shoot there, fish there, traverse long grass-grown Roman
roads there, open ancient barrows there, see many a square mile of richly
cultivated land there, and hold Arcadian talk with a bold peasantry,
their country&rsquo;s pride, who will tell you (if you want to know)
how pastoral housekeeping is done on nine shillings a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller sat at his breakfast in the little sanded parlour of
the Peal of Bells village alehouse, with the dew and dust of an early
walk upon his shoes&mdash;an early walk by road and meadow and coppice,
that had sprinkled him bountifully with little blades of grass, and
scraps of new hay, and with leaves both young and old, and with other
such fragrant tokens of the freshness and wealth of summer.&nbsp; The
window through which the landlord had concentrated his gaze upon vacancy
was shaded, because the morning sun was hot and bright on the village
street.&nbsp; The village street was like most other village streets:
wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest
degree.&nbsp; The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters
(to shut up Nothing as carefully as if it were the Mint, or the Bank
of England) had called in the Doctor&rsquo;s house so suddenly, that
his brass door-plate and three stories stood among them as conspicuous
and different as the doctor himself in his broadcloth, among the smock-frocks
of his patients.&nbsp; The village residences seemed to have gone to
law with a similar absence of consideration, for a score of weak little
lath-and-plaster cabins clung in confusion about the Attorney&rsquo;s
red-brick house, which, with glaring door-steps and a most terrific
scraper, seemed to serve all manner of ejectments upon them.&nbsp; They
were as various as labourers&mdash;high-shouldered, wry-necked, one-eyed,
goggle-eyed, squinting, bow-legged, knock-knee&rsquo;d, rheumatic, crazy.&nbsp;
Some of the small tradesmen&rsquo;s houses, such as the crockery-shop
and the harness-maker, had a Cyclops window in the middle of the gable,
within an inch or two of its apex, suggesting that some forlorn rural
Prentice must wriggle himself into that apartment horizontally, when
he retired to rest, after the manner of the worm.&nbsp; So bountiful
in its abundance was the surrounding country, and so lean and scant
the village, that one might have thought the village had sown and planted
everything it once possessed, to convert the same into crops.&nbsp;
This would account for the bareness of the little shops, the bareness
of the few boards and trestles designed for market purposes in a corner
of the street, the bareness of the obsolete Inn and Inn Yard, with the
ominous inscription &ldquo;Excise Office&rdquo; not yet faded out from
the gateway, as indicating the very last thing that poverty could get
rid of.&nbsp; This would also account for the determined abandonment
of the village by one stray dog, fast lessening in the perspective where
the white posts and the pond were, and would explain his conduct on
the hypothesis that he was going (through the act of suicide) to convert
himself into manure, and become a part proprietor in turnips or mangold-wurzel.</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller having finished his breakfast and paid his moderate
score, walked out to the threshold of the Peal of Bells, and, thence
directed by the pointing finger of his host, betook himself towards
the ruined hermitage of Mr. Mopes the hermit.</p>
<p>For, Mr. Mopes, by suffering everything about him to go to ruin,
and by dressing himself in a blanket and skewer, and by steeping himself
in soot and grease and other nastiness, had acquired great renown in
all that country-side&mdash;far greater renown than he could ever have
won for himself, if his career had been that of any ordinary Christian,
or decent Hottentot.&nbsp; He had even blanketed and skewered and sooted
and greased himself, into the London papers.&nbsp; And it was curious
to find, as Mr. Traveller found by stopping for a new direction at this
farm-house or at that cottage as he went along, with how much accuracy
the morbid Mopes had counted on the weakness of his neighbours to embellish
him.&nbsp; A mist of home-brewed marvel and romance surrounded Mopes,
in which (as in all fogs) the real proportions of the real object were
extravagantly heightened.&nbsp; He had murdered his beautiful beloved
in a fit of jealousy and was doing penance; he had made a vow under
the influence of grief; he had made a vow under the influence of a fatal
accident; he had made a vow under the influence of religion; he had
made a vow under the influence of drink; he had made a vow under the
influence of disappointment; he had never made any vow, but &ldquo;had
got led into it&rdquo; by the possession of a mighty and most awful
secret; he was enormously rich, he was stupendously charitable, he was
profoundly learned, he saw spectres, he knew and could do all kinds
of wonders.&nbsp; Some said he went out every night, and was met by
terrified wayfarers stalking along dark roads, others said he never
went out, some knew his penance to be nearly expired, others had positive
information that his seclusion was not a penance at all, and would never
expire but with himself.&nbsp; Even, as to the easy facts of how old
he was, or how long he had held verminous occupation of his blanket
and skewer, no consistent information was to be got, from those who
must know if they would.&nbsp; He was represented as being all the ages
between five-and-twenty and sixty, and as having been a hermit seven
years, twelve, twenty, thirty,&mdash;though twenty, on the whole, appeared
the favourite term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any
rate, let us see what a real live Hermit looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Mr. Traveller went on, and on, and on, until he came to Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s
Ground.</p>
<p>It was a nook in a rustic by-road, which the genius of Mopes had
laid waste as completely, as if he had been born an Emperor and a Conqueror.&nbsp;
Its centre object was a dwelling-house, sufficiently substantial, all
the window-glass of which had been long ago abolished by the surprising
genius of Mopes, and all the windows of which were barred across with
rough-split logs of trees nailed over them on the outside.&nbsp; A rickyard,
hip-high in vegetable rankness and ruin, contained outbuildings from
which the thatch had lightly fluttered away, on all the winds of all
the seasons of the year, and from which the planks and beams had heavily
dropped and rotted.&nbsp; The frosts and damps of winter, and the heats
of summer, had warped what wreck remained, so that not a post or a board
retained the position it was meant to hold, but everything was twisted
from its purpose, like its owner, and degraded and debased.&nbsp; In
this homestead of the sluggard, behind the ruined hedge, and sinking
away among the ruined grass and the nettles, were the last perishing
fragments of certain ricks: which had gradually mildewed and collapsed,
until they looked like mounds of rotten honeycomb, or dirty sponge.&nbsp;
Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground could even show its ruined water; for, there
was a slimy pond into which a tree or two had fallen&mdash;one soppy
trunk and branches lay across it then&mdash;which in its accumulation
of stagnant weed, and in its black decomposition, and in all its foulness
and filth, was almost comforting, regarded as the only water that could
have reflected the shameful place without seeming polluted by that low
office.</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller looked all around him on Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground,
and his glance at last encountered a dusky Tinker lying among the weeds
and rank grass, in the shade of the dwelling-house.&nbsp; A rough walking-staff
lay on the ground by his side, and his head rested on a small wallet.&nbsp;
He met Mr. Traveller&rsquo;s eye without lifting up his head, merely
depressing his chin a little (for he was lying on his back) to get a
better view of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you, if you like it,&rdquo; returned the Tinker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> like it?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very fine
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t partickler in weather,&rdquo; returned the Tinker,
with a yawn.</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller had walked up to where he lay, and was looking down
at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a curious place,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I suppose so!&rdquo; returned the Tinker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom
Tiddler&rsquo;s ground, they call this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you well acquainted with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw it afore to-day,&rdquo; said the Tinker, with another
yawn, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t care if I never see it again.&nbsp; There
was a man here just now, told me what it was called.&nbsp; If you want
to see Tom himself, you must go in at that gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; He faintly
indicated with his chin a little mean ruin of a wooden gate at the side
of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I ain&rsquo;t partickler to see him.&nbsp; I can see
a dirty man anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not live in the house, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller,
casting his eyes upon the house anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man said,&rdquo; returned the Tinker, rather irritably,&mdash;&ldquo;him
as was here just now, &lsquo;this what you&rsquo;re a laying on, mate,
is Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground.&nbsp; And if you want to see Tom,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;you must go in at that gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man come
out at that gate himself, and he ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though, perhaps,&rdquo; exclaimed the Tinker, so struck by
the brightness of his own idea, that it had the electric effect upon
him of causing him to lift up his head an inch or so, &ldquo;perhaps
he was a liar!&nbsp; He told some rum &rsquo;uns&mdash;him as was here
just now, did about this place of Tom&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He says&mdash;him
as was here just now&mdash;&lsquo;When Tom shut up the house, mate,
to go to rack, the beds was left, all made, like as if somebody was
a-going to sleep in every bed.&nbsp; And if you was to walk through
the bedrooms now, you&rsquo;d see the ragged mouldy bedclothes a heaving
and a heaving like seas.&nbsp; And a heaving and a heaving with what?&rsquo;
he says.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, with the rats under &rsquo;em.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had seen that man,&rdquo; Mr. Traveller remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been welcome to see him instead of me seeing
him,&rdquo; growled the Tinker; &ldquo;for he was a long-winded one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not without a sense of injury in the remembrance, the Tinker gloomily
closed his eyes.&nbsp; Mr. Traveller, deeming the Tinker a short-winded
one, from whom no further breath of information was to be derived, betook
himself to the gate.</p>
<p>Swung upon its rusty hinges, it admitted him into a yard in which
there was nothing to be seen but an outhouse attached to the ruined
building, with a barred window in it.&nbsp; As there were traces of
many recent footsteps under this window, and as it was a low window,
and unglazed, Mr. Traveller made bold to peep within the bars.&nbsp;
And there to be sure he had a real live Hermit before him, and could
judge how the real dead Hermits used to look.</p>
<p>He was lying on a bank of soot and cinders, on the floor, in front
of a rusty fireplace.&nbsp; There was nothing else in the dark little
kitchen, or scullery, or whatever his den had been originally used as,
but a table with a litter of old bottles on it.&nbsp; A rat made a clatter
among these bottles, jumped down, and ran over the real live Hermit
on his way to his hole, or the man in <i>his</i> hole would not have
been so easily discernible.&nbsp; Tickled in the face by the rat&rsquo;s
tail, the owner of Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground opened his eyes, saw Mr.
Traveller, started up, and sprang to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; thought Mr. Traveller, retiring a pace or two
from the bars.&nbsp; &ldquo;A compound of Newgate, Bedlam, a Debtors&rsquo;
Prison in the worst time, a chimney-sweep, a mudlark, and the Noble
Savage!&nbsp; A nice old family, the Hermit family.&nbsp; Hah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller thought this, as he silently confronted the sooty object
in the blanket and skewer (in sober truth it wore nothing else), with
the matted hair and the staring eyes.&nbsp; Further, Mr. Traveller thought,
as the eye surveyed him with a very obvious curiosity in ascertaining
the effect they produced, &ldquo;Vanity, vanity, vanity!&nbsp; Verily,
all is vanity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, sir, and where do you come from?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Mopes the Hermit&mdash;with an air of authority, but in the
ordinary human speech of one who has been to school.</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller answered the inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you come here, sir, to see <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&nbsp; I heard of you, and I came to see you.&mdash;I
know you like to be seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Traveller coolly threw the
last words in, as a matter of course, to forestall an affectation of
resentment or objection that he saw rising beneath the grease and grime
of the face.&nbsp; They had their effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the Hermit, after a momentary silence, unclasping
the bars by which he had previously held, and seating himself behind
them on the ledge of the window, with his bare legs and feet crouched
up, &ldquo;you know I like to be seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller looked about him for something to sit on, and, observing
a billet of wood in a corner, brought it near the window.&nbsp; Deliberately
seating himself upon it, he answered, &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each looked at the other, and each appeared to take some pains to
get the measure of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have come to ask me why I lead this life,&rdquo;
said the Hermit, frowning in a stormy manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never tell
that to any human being.&nbsp; I will not be asked that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you will not be asked that by me,&rdquo; said Mr.
Traveller, &ldquo;for I have not the slightest desire to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an uncouth man,&rdquo; said Mr. Mopes the Hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are another,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>The Hermit, who was plainly in the habit of overawing his visitors
with the novelty of his filth and his blanket and skewer, glared at
his present visitor in some discomfiture and surprise: as if he had
taken aim at him with a sure gun, and his piece had missed fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you come here at all?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my life,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller, &ldquo;I was made
to ask myself that very question only a few minutes ago&mdash;by a Tinker
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he glanced towards the gate in saying it, the Hermit glanced in
that direction likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He is lying on his back in the sunlight outside,&rdquo;
said Mr, Traveller, as if he had been asked concerning the man, &ldquo;and
he won&rsquo;t come in; for he says&mdash;and really very reasonably&mdash;&lsquo;What
should I come in for?&nbsp; I can see a dirty man anywhere.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an insolent person.&nbsp; Go away from my premises.&nbsp;
Go!&rdquo; said the Hermit, in an imperious and angry tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; returned Mr. Traveller, quite undisturbed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is a little too much.&nbsp; You are not going to call yourself
clean?&nbsp; Look at your legs.&nbsp; And as to these being your premises:&mdash;they
are in far too disgraceful a condition to claim any privilege of ownership,
or anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermit bounced down from his window-ledge, and cast himself on
his bed of soot and cinders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller, glancing in after
him; &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t get rid of me in that way.&nbsp; You had
better come and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said the Hermit, flouncing round
to get his back towards the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should
you take it ill that I have no curiosity to know why you live this highly
absurd and highly indecent life?&nbsp; When I contemplate a man in a
state of disease, surely there is no moral obligation on me to be anxious
to know how he took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short silence, the Hermit bounced up again, and came back
to the barred window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; You are not gone?&rdquo; he said, affecting to
have supposed that he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor going,&rdquo; Mr. Traveller replied: &ldquo;I design to
pass this summer day here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you come, sir, upon my promises&mdash;&rdquo; the
Hermit was returning, when his visitor interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, you know, you must <i>not</i> talk about your premises.&nbsp;
I cannot allow such a place as this to be dignified with the name of
premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you,&rdquo; said the Hermit, shaking his bars, &ldquo;come
in at my gate, to taunt me with being in a diseased state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lord bless my soul,&rdquo; returned the other, very composedly,
&ldquo;you have not the face to say that you are in a wholesome state?&nbsp;
Do allow me again to call your attention to your legs.&nbsp; Scrape
yourself anywhere&mdash;with anything&mdash;and then tell me you are
in a wholesome state.&nbsp; The fact is, Mr. Mopes, that you are not
only a Nuisance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Nuisance?&rdquo; repeated the Hermit, fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a place in this obscene state of dilapidation but
a Nuisance?&nbsp; What is a man in your obscene state of dilapidation
but a Nuisance?&nbsp; Then, as you very well know, you cannot do without
an audience, and your audience is a Nuisance.&nbsp; You attract all
the disreputable vagabonds and prowlers within ten miles around, by
exhibiting yourself to them in that objectionable blanket, and by throwing
copper money among them, and giving them drink out of those very dirty
jars and bottles that I see in there (their stomachs need be strong!);
and in short,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller, summing up in a quietly and
comfortably settled manner, &ldquo;you are a Nuisance, and this kennel
is a Nuisance, and the audience that you cannot possibly dispense with
is a Nuisance, and the Nuisance is not merely a local Nuisance, because
it is a general Nuisance to know that there <i>can be</i> such a Nuisance
left in civilisation so very long after its time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go away?&nbsp; I have a gun in here,&rdquo; said
the Hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I put it to you.&nbsp; Did I say you had not?&nbsp; And
as to going away, didn&rsquo;t I say I am not going away?&nbsp; You
have made me forget where I was.&nbsp; I now remember that I was remarking
on your conduct being a Nuisance.&nbsp; Moreover, it is in the last
and lowest degree inconsequent foolishness and weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weakness?&rdquo; echoed the Hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weakness,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller, with his former comfortably
settled final air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I weak, you fool?&rdquo; cried the Hermit, &ldquo;I, who have
held to my purpose, and my diet, and my only bed there, all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more the years, the weaker you,&rdquo; returned Mr. Traveller.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though the years are not so many as folks say, and as you willingly
take credit for.&nbsp; The crust upon your face is thick and dark, Mr.
Mopes, but I can see enough of you through it, to see that you are still
a young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inconsequent foolishness is lunacy, I suppose?&rdquo; said
the Hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is very like it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I converse like a lunatic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us two must have a strong presumption against him of
being one, whether or no.&nbsp; Either the clean and decorously clad
man, or the dirty and indecorously clad man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you self-sufficient bear,&rdquo; said the Hermit, &ldquo;not
a day passes but I am justified in my purpose by the conversations I
hold here; not a day passes but I am shown, by everything I hear and
see here, how right and strong I am in holding my purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller, lounging easily on his billet of wood, took out a
pocket pipe and began to fill it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, that a man,&rdquo;
he said, appealing to the summer sky as he did so, &ldquo;that a man&mdash;even
behind bars, in a blanket and skewer&mdash;should tell me that he can
see, from day to day, any orders or conditions of men, women, or children,
who can by any possibility teach him that it is anything but the miserablest
drivelling for a human creature to quarrel with his social nature&mdash;not
to go so far as to say, to renounce his common human decency, for that
is an extreme case; or who can teach him that he can in any wise separate
himself from his kind and the habits of his kind, without becoming a
deteriorated spectacle calculated to give the Devil (and perhaps the
monkeys) pleasure,&mdash;is something wonderful!&nbsp; I repeat,&rdquo;
said Mr. Traveller, beginning to smoke, &ldquo;the unreasoning hardihood
of it is something wonderful&mdash;even in a man with the dirt upon
him an inch or two thick&mdash;behind bars&mdash;in a blanket and skewer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hermit looked at him irresolutely, and retired to his soot and
cinders and lay down, and got up again and came to the bars, and again
looked at him irresolutely, and finally said with sharpness: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like dirt,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Traveller; &ldquo;tobacco
is an excellent disinfectant.&nbsp; We shall both be the better for
my pipe.&nbsp; It is my intention to sit here through this summer day,
until that blessed summer sun sinks low in the west, and to show you
what a poor creature you are, through the lips of every chance wayfarer
who may come in at your gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired the Hermit, with a furious
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that yonder is your gate, and there are you, and here
am I; I mean that I know it to be a moral impossibility that any person
can stray in at that gate from any point of the compass, with any sort
of experience, gained at first hand, or derived from another, that can
confute me and justify you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an arrogant and boastful hero,&rdquo; said the Hermit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think yourself profoundly wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; returned Mr. Traveller, quietly smoking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is little wisdom in knowing that every man must be up and
doing, and that all mankind are made dependent on one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have companions outside,&rdquo; said the Hermit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not to be imposed upon by your assumed confidence in the
people who may enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A depraved distrust,&rdquo; returned the visitor, compassionately
raising his eyebrows, &ldquo;of course belongs to your state, I can&rsquo;t
help that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you have no confederates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to tell you nothing but what I have told you.&nbsp;
What I have told you is, that it is a moral impossibility that any son
or daughter of Adam can stand on this ground that I put my foot on,
or on any ground that mortal treads, and gainsay the healthy tenure
on which we hold our existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is,&rdquo; sneered the Hermit, &ldquo;according to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is,&rdquo; returned the other, &ldquo;according to Eternal
Providence, that we must arise and wash our faces and do our gregarious
work and act and re-act on one another, leaving only the idiot and the
palsied to sit blinking in the corner.&nbsp; Come!&rdquo; apostrophising
the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open Sesame!&nbsp; Show his eyes and grieve his
heart!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care who comes, for I know what must come
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he faced round a little on his billet of wood towards
the gate; and Mr. Mopes, the Hermit, after two or three ridiculous bounces
of indecision at his bed and back again, submitted to what he could
not help himself against, and coiled himself on his window-ledge, holding
to his bars and looking out rather anxiously.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;PICKING UP MISS KIMMEENS <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a></h2>
<p>The day was by this time waning, when the gate again opened, and,
with the brilliant golden light that streamed from the declining sun
and touched the very bars of the sooty creature&rsquo;s den, there passed
in a little child; a little girl with beautiful bright hair.&nbsp; She
wore a plain straw hat, had a door-key in her hand, and tripped towards
Mr. Traveller as if she were pleased to see him and were going to repose
some childish confidence in him, when she caught sight of the figure
behind the bars, and started back in terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, darling!&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller,
taking her by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; urged the shrinking
child; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like it either,&rdquo; said Mr.
Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has put it there?&rdquo; asked the little girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does it bite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;only barks.&nbsp; But can&rsquo;t you make up your
mind to see it, my dear?&rdquo;&nbsp; For she was covering her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no no no!&rdquo; returned the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot
bear to look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller turned his head towards his friend in there, as much
as to ask him how he liked that instance of his success, and then took
the child out at the still open gate, and stood talking to her for some
half an hour in the mellow sunlight.&nbsp; At length he returned, encouraging
her as she held his arm with both her hands; and laying his protecting
hand upon her head and smoothing her pretty hair, he addressed his friend
behind the bars as follows:</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Miss Pupford&rsquo;s establishment for six young ladies of tender
years, is an establishment of a compact nature, an establishment in
miniature, quite a pocket establishment.&nbsp; Miss Pupford, Miss Pupford&rsquo;s
assistant with the Parisian accent, Miss Pupford&rsquo;s cook, and Miss
Pupford&rsquo;s housemaid, complete what Miss Pupford calls the educational
and domestic staff of her Lilliputian College.</p>
<p>Miss Pupford is one of the most amiable of her sex; it necessarily
follows that she possesses a sweet temper, and would own to the possession
of a great deal of sentiment if she considered it quite reconcilable
with her duty to parents.&nbsp; Deeming it not in the bond, Miss Pupford
keeps it as far out of sight as she can&mdash;which (God bless her!)
is not very far.</p>
<p>Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant with the Parisian accent, may be regarded
as in some sort an inspired lady, for she never conversed with a Parisian,
and was never out of England&mdash;except once in the pleasure-boat
Lively, in the foreign waters that ebb and flow two miles off Margate
at high water.&nbsp; Even under those geographically favourable circumstances
for the acquisition of the French language in its utmost politeness
and purity, Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant did not fully profit by the
opportunity; for the pleasure-boat, Lively, so strongly asserted its
title to its name on that occasion, that she was reduced to the condition
of lying in the bottom of the boat pickling in brine&mdash;as if she
were being salted down for the use of the Navy&mdash;undergoing at the
same time great mental alarm, corporeal distress, and clear-starching
derangement.</p>
<p>When Miss Pupford and her assistant first foregathered, is not known
to men, or pupils.&nbsp; But, it was long ago.&nbsp; A belief would
have established itself among pupils that the two once went to school
together, were it not for the difficulty and audacity of imagining Miss
Pupford born without mittens, and without a front, and without a bit
of gold wire among her front teeth, and without little dabs of powder
on her neat little face and nose.&nbsp; Indeed, whenever Miss Pupford
gives a little lecture on the mythology of the misguided heathens (always
carefully excluding Cupid from recognition), and tells how Minerva sprang,
perfectly equipped, from the brain of Jupiter, she is half supposed
to hint, &ldquo;So I myself came into the world, completely up in Pinnock,
Mangnall, Tables, and the use of the Globes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howbeit, Miss Pupford and Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant are old
old friends.&nbsp; And it is thought by pupils that, after pupils are
gone to bed, they even call one another by their christian names in
the quiet little parlour.&nbsp; For, once upon a time on a thunderous
afternoon, when Miss Pupford fainted away without notice, Miss Pupford&rsquo;s
assistant (never heard, before or since, to address her otherwise than
as Miss Pupford) ran to her, crying out, &ldquo;My dearest Euphemia!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Euphemia is Miss Pupford&rsquo;s christian name on the sampler (date
picked out) hanging up in the College-hall, where the two peacocks,
terrified to death by some German text that is waddling down-hill after
them out of a cottage, are scuttling away to hide their profiles in
two immense bean-stalks growing out of flower-pots.</p>
<p>Also, there is a notion latent among pupils, that Miss Pupford was
once in love, and that the beloved object still moves upon this ball.&nbsp;
Also, that he is a public character, and a personage of vast consequence.&nbsp;
Also, that Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant knows all about it.&nbsp;
For, sometimes of an afternoon when Miss Pupford has been reading the
paper through her little gold eye-glass (it is necessary to read it
on the spot, as the boy calls for it, with ill-conditioned punctuality,
in an hour), she has become agitated, and has said to her assistant
&ldquo;G!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant has gone
to Miss Pupford, and Miss Pupford has pointed out, with her eye-glass,
G in the paper, and then Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant has read about
G, and has shown sympathy.&nbsp; So stimulated has the pupil-mind been
in its time to curiosity on the subject of G, that once, under temporary
circumstances favourable to the bold sally, one fearless pupil did actually
obtain possession of the paper, and range all over it in search of G,
who had been discovered therein by Miss Pupford not ten minutes before.&nbsp;
But no G could be identified, except one capital offender who had been
executed in a state of great hardihood, and it was not to be supposed
that Miss Pupford could ever have loved <i>him</i>.&nbsp; Besides, he
couldn&rsquo;t be always being executed.&nbsp; Besides, he got into
the paper again, alive, within a month.</p>
<p>On the whole, it is suspected by the pupil-mind that G is a short
chubby old gentleman, with little black sealing-wax boots up to his
knees, whom a sharply observant pupil, Miss Linx, when she once went
to Tunbridge Wells with Miss Pupford for the holidays, reported on her
return (privately and confidentially) to have seen come capering up
to Miss Pupford on the Promenade, and to have detected in the act of
squeezing Miss Pupford&rsquo;s hand, and to have heard pronounce the
words, &ldquo;Cruel Euphemia, ever thine!&rdquo;&mdash;or something
like that.&nbsp; Miss Linx hazarded a guess that he might be House of
Commons, or Money Market, or Court Circular, or Fashionable Movements;
which would account for his getting into the paper so often.&nbsp; But,
it was fatally objected by the pupil-mind, that none of those notabilities
could possibly be spelt with a G.</p>
<p>There are other occasions, closely watched and perfectly comprehended
by the pupil-mind, when Miss Pupford imparts with mystery to her assistant
that there is special excitement in the morning paper.&nbsp; These occasions
are, when Miss Pupford finds an old pupil coming out under the head
of Births, or Marriages.&nbsp; Affectionate tears are invariably seen
in Miss Pupford&rsquo;s meek little eyes when this is the case; and
the pupil-mind, perceiving that its order has distinguished itself&mdash;though
the fact is never mentioned by Miss Pupford&mdash;becomes elevated,
and feels that it likewise is reserved for greatness.</p>
<p>Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant with the Parisian accent has a little
more bone than Miss Pupford, but is of the same trim orderly diminutive
cast, and, from long contemplation, admiration, and imitation of Miss
Pupford, has grown like her.&nbsp; Being entirely devoted to Miss Pupford,
and having a pretty talent for pencil-drawing, she once made a portrait
of that lady: which was so instantly identified and hailed by the pupils,
that it was done on stone at five shillings.&nbsp; Surely the softest
and milkiest stone that ever was quarried, received that likeness of
Miss Pupford!&nbsp; The lines of her placid little nose are so undecided
in it that strangers to the work of art are observed to be exceedingly
perplexed as to where the nose goes to, and involuntarily feel their
own noses in a disconcerted manner.&nbsp; Miss Pupford being represented
in a state of dejection at an open window, ruminating over a bowl of
gold fish, the pupil-mind has settled that the bowl was presented by
G, and that he wreathed the bowl with flowers of soul, and that Miss
Pupford is depicted as waiting for him on a memorable occasion when
he was behind his time.</p>
<p>The approach of the last Midsummer holidays had a particular interest
for the pupil-mind, by reason of its knowing that Miss Pupford was bidden,
on the second day of those holidays, to the nuptials of a former pupil.&nbsp;
As it was impossible to conceal the fact&mdash;so extensive were the
dress-making preparations&mdash;Miss Pupford openly announced it.&nbsp;
But, she held it due to parents to make the announcement with an air
of gentle melancholy, as if marriage were (as indeed it exceptionally
has been) rather a calamity.&nbsp; With an air of softened resignation
and pity, therefore, Miss Pupford went on with her preparations: and
meanwhile no pupil ever went up-stairs, or came down, without peeping
in at the door of Miss Pupford&rsquo;s bedroom (when Miss Pupford wasn&rsquo;t
there), and bringing back some surprising intelligence concerning the
bonnet.</p>
<p>The extensive preparations being completed on the day before the
holidays, an unanimous entreaty was preferred to Miss Pupford by the
pupil-mind&mdash;finding expression through Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant&mdash;that
she would deign to appear in all her splendour.&nbsp; Miss Pupford consenting,
presented a lovely spectacle.&nbsp; And although the oldest pupil was
barely thirteen, every one of the six became in two minutes perfect
in the shape, cut, colour, price, and quality, of every article Miss
Pupford wore.</p>
<p>Thus delightfully ushered in, the holidays began.&nbsp; Five of the
six pupils kissed little Kitty Kimmeens twenty times over (round total,
one hundred times, for she was very popular), and so went home.&nbsp;
Miss Kitty Kimmeens remained behind, for her relations and friends were
all in India, far away.&nbsp; A self-helpful steady little child is
Miss Kitty Kimmeens: a dimpled child too, and a loving.</p>
<p>So, the great marriage-day came, and Miss Pupford, quite as much
fluttered as any bride could be (G! thought Miss Kitty Kimmeens), went
away, splendid to behold, in the carriage that was sent for her.&nbsp;
But not Miss Pupford only went away; for Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant
went away with her, on a dutiful visit to an aged uncle&mdash;though
surely the venerable gentleman couldn&rsquo;t live in the gallery of
the church where the marriage was to be, thought Miss Kitty Kimmeens&mdash;and
yet Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant had let out that she was going there.&nbsp;
Where the cook was going, didn&rsquo;t appear, but she generally conveyed
to Miss Kimmeens that she was bound, rather against her will, on a pilgrimage
to perform some pious office that rendered new ribbons necessary to
her best bonnet, and also sandals to her shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; said the housemaid, when they were all
gone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nobody left in the house but you and me,
Miss Kimmeens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody else,&rdquo; said Miss Kitty Kimmeens, shaking her
curls a little sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t like your Bella to go too; would you,
Miss Kimmeens?&rdquo; said the housemaid.&nbsp; (She being Bella.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; answered little Miss Kimmeens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor Bella is forced to stay with you, whether she likes
it or not; ain&rsquo;t she, Miss Kimmeens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> you like it?&rdquo; inquired Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re such a darling, Miss, that it would be unkind
of your Bella to make objections.&nbsp; Yet my brother-in-law has been
took unexpected bad by this morning&rsquo;s post.&nbsp; And your poor
Bella is much attached to him, letting alone her favourite sister, Miss
Kimmeens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he very ill?&rdquo; asked little Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor Bella has her fears so, Miss Kimmeens,&rdquo; returned
the housemaid, with her apron at her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was but his
inside, it is true, but it might mount, and the doctor said that if
it mounted he wouldn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the housemaid
was so overcome that Kitty administered the only comfort she had ready:
which was a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for disappointing Cook, dear Miss
Kimmeens,&rdquo; said the housemaid, &ldquo;your Bella would have asked
her to stay with you.&nbsp; For Cook is sweet company, Miss Kimmeens,
much more so than your own poor Bella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are very nice, Bella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Bella could wish to be so, Miss Kimmeens,&rdquo; returned
the housemaid, &ldquo;but she knows full well that it do not lay in
her power this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which despondent conviction, the housemaid drew a heavy sigh,
and shook her head, and dropped it on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it had been anyways right to disappoint Cook,&rdquo; she
pursued, in a contemplative and abstracted manner, &ldquo;it might have
been so easy done!&nbsp; I could have got to my brother-in-law&rsquo;s,
and had the best part of the day there, and got back, long before our
ladies come home at night, and neither the one nor the other of them
need never have known it.&nbsp; Not that Miss Pupford would at all object,
but that it might put her out, being tender-hearted.&nbsp; Hows&rsquo;ever,
your own poor Bella, Miss Kimmeens,&rdquo; said the housemaid, rousing
herself, &ldquo;is forced to stay with you, and you&rsquo;re a precious
love, if not a liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bella,&rdquo; said little Kitty, after a short silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call your own poor Bella, your Bella, dear,&rdquo; the housemaid
besought her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Bella, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your considerate heart!&rdquo; said the housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would not mind leaving me, I should not mind being
left.&nbsp; I am not afraid to stay in the house alone.&nbsp; And you
need not be uneasy on my account, for I would be very careful to do
no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&nbsp; As to harm, you more than sweetest, if not a liberty,&rdquo;
exclaimed the housemaid, in a rapture, &ldquo;your Bella could trust
you anywhere, being so steady, and so answerable.&nbsp; The oldest head
in this house (me and Cook says), but for its bright hair, is Miss Kimmeens.&nbsp;
But no, I will not leave you; for you would think your Bella unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you are my Bella, you <i>must</i> go,&rdquo; returned
the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; said the housemaid, rising, on the whole with
alacrity.&nbsp; &ldquo;What must be, must be, Miss Kimmeens.&nbsp; Your
own poor Bella acts according, though unwilling.&nbsp; But go or stay,
your own poor Bella loves you, Miss Kimmeens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly go, and not stay, for within five minutes Miss Kimmeens&rsquo;s
own poor Bella&mdash;so much improved in point of spirits as to have
grown almost sanguine on the subject of her brother-in-law&mdash;went
her way, in apparel that seemed to have been expressly prepared for
some festive occasion.&nbsp; Such are the changes of this fleeting world,
and so short-sighted are we poor mortals!</p>
<p>When the house door closed with a bang and a shake, it seemed to
Miss Kimmeens to be a very heavy house door, shutting her up in a wilderness
of a house.&nbsp; But, Miss Kimmeens being, as before stated, of a self-reliant
and methodical character, presently began to parcel out the long summer-day
before her.</p>
<p>And first she thought she would go all over the house, to make quite
sure that nobody with a great-coat on and a carving-knife in it, had
got under one of the beds or into one of the cupboards.&nbsp; Not that
she had ever before been troubled by the image of anybody armed with
a great-coat and a carving-knife, but that it seemed to have been shaken
into existence by the shake and the bang of the great street-door, reverberating
through the solitary house.&nbsp; So, little Miss Kimmeens looked under
the five empty beds of the five departed pupils, and looked, under her
own bed, and looked under Miss Pupford&rsquo;s bed, and looked under
Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistants bed.&nbsp; And when she had done this,
and was making the tour of the cupboards, the disagreeable thought came
into her young head, What a very alarming thing it would be to find
somebody with a mask on, like Guy Fawkes, hiding bolt upright in a corner
and pretending not to be alive!&nbsp; However, Miss Kimmeens having
finished her inspection without making any such uncomfortable discovery,
sat down in her tidy little manner to needlework, and began stitching
away at a great rate.</p>
<p>The silence all about her soon grew very oppressive, and the more
so because of the odd inconsistency that the more silent it was, the
more noises there were.&nbsp; The noise of her own needle and thread
as she stitched, was infinitely louder in her ears than the stitching
of all the six pupils, and of Miss Pupford, and of Miss Pupford&rsquo;s
assistant, all stitching away at once on a highly emulative afternoon.&nbsp;
Then, the schoolroom clock conducted itself in a way in which it had
never conducted itself before&mdash;fell lame, somehow, and yet persisted
in running on as hard and as loud as it could: the consequence of which
behaviour was, that it staggered among the minutes in a state of the
greatest confusion, and knocked them about in all directions without
appearing to get on with its regular work.&nbsp; Perhaps this alarmed
the stairs; but be that as it might, they began to creak in a most unusual
manner, and then the furniture began to crack, and then poor little
Miss Kimmeens, not liking the furtive aspect of things in general, began
to sing as she stitched.&nbsp; But, it was not her own voice that she
heard&mdash;it was somebody else making believe to be Kitty, and singing
excessively flat, without any heart&mdash;so as that would never mend
matters, she left off again.</p>
<p>By-and-by the stitching became so palpable a failure that Miss Kitty
Kimmeens folded her work neatly, and put it away in its box, and gave
it up.&nbsp; Then the question arose about reading.&nbsp; But no; the
book that was so delightful when there was somebody she loved for her
eyes to fall on when they rose from the page, had not more heart in
it than her own singing now.&nbsp; The book went to its shelf as the
needlework had gone to its box, and, since something <i>must</i> be
done&mdash;thought the child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go put my room to rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shared her room with her dearest little friend among the other
five pupils, and why then should she now conceive a lurking dread of
the little friend&rsquo;s bedstead?&nbsp; But she did.&nbsp; There was
a stealthy air about its innocent white curtains, and there were even
dark hints of a dead girl lying under the coverlet.&nbsp; The great
want of human company, the great need of a human face, began now to
express itself in the facility with which the furniture put on strange
exaggerated resemblances to human looks.&nbsp; A chair with a menacing
frown was horribly out of temper in a corner; a most vicious chest of
drawers snarled at her from between the windows.&nbsp; It was no relief
to escape from those monsters to the looking-glass, for the reflection
said, &ldquo;What?&nbsp; Is that you all alone there?&nbsp; How you
stare!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the background was all a great void stare as
well.</p>
<p>The day dragged on, dragging Kitty with it very slowly by the hair
of her head, until it was time to eat.&nbsp; There were good provisions
in the pantry, but their right flavour and relish had evaporated with
the five pupils, and Miss Pupford, and Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant,
and the cook and housemaid.&nbsp; Where was the use of laying the cloth
symmetrically for one small guest, who had gone on ever since the morning
growing smaller and smaller, while the empty house had gone on swelling
larger and larger?&nbsp; The very Grace came out wrong, for who were
&ldquo;we&rdquo; who were going to receive and be thankful?&nbsp; So,
Miss Kimmeens was <i>not</i> thankful, and found herself taking her
dinner in very slovenly style&mdash;gobbling it up, in short, rather
after the manner of the lower animals, not to particularise the pigs.</p>
<p>But, this was by no means the worst of the change wrought out in
the naturally loving and cheery little creature as the solitary day
wore on.&nbsp; She began to brood and be suspicious.&nbsp; She discovered
that she was full of wrongs and injuries.&nbsp; All the people she knew,
got tainted by her lonely thoughts and turned bad.</p>
<p>It was all very well for Papa, a widower in India, to send her home
to be educated, and to pay a handsome round sum every year for her to
Miss Pupford, and to write charming letters to his darling little daughter;
but what did he care for her being left by herself, when he was (as
no doubt he always was) enjoying himself in company from morning till
night?&nbsp; Perhaps he only sent her here, after all, to get her out
of the way.&nbsp; It looked like it&mdash;looked like it to-day, that
is, for she had never dreamed of such a thing before.</p>
<p>And this old pupil who was being married.&nbsp; It was unsupportably
conceited and selfish in the old pupil to be married.&nbsp; She was
very vain, and very glad to show off; but it was highly probable that
she wasn&rsquo;t pretty; and even if she were pretty (which Miss Kimmeens
now totally denied), she had no business to be married; and, even if
marriage were conceded, she had no business to ask Miss Pupford to her
wedding.&nbsp; As to Miss Pupford, she was too old to go to any wedding.&nbsp;
She ought to know that.&nbsp; She had much better attend to her business.&nbsp;
She had thought she looked nice in the morning, but she didn&rsquo;t
look nice.&nbsp; She was a stupid old thing.&nbsp; G was another stupid
old thing.&nbsp; Miss Pupford&rsquo;s assistant was another.&nbsp; They
were all stupid old things together.</p>
<p>More than that: it began to be obvious that this was a plot.&nbsp;
They had said to one another, &ldquo;Never mind Kitty; you get off,
and I&rsquo;ll get off; and we&rsquo;ll leave Kitty to look after herself.&nbsp;
Who cares for her?&rdquo;&nbsp; To be sure they were right in that question;
for who <i>did</i> care for her, a poor little lonely thing against
whom they all planned and plotted?&nbsp; Nobody, nobody!&nbsp; Here
Kitty sobbed.</p>
<p>At all other times she was the pet of the whole house, and loved
her five companions in return with a child&rsquo;s tenderest and most
ingenuous attachment; but now, the five companions put on ugly colours,
and appeared for the first time under a sullen cloud.&nbsp; There they
were, all at their homes that day, being made much of, being taken out,
being spoilt and made disagreeable, and caring nothing for her.&nbsp;
It was like their artful selfishness always to tell her when they came
back, under pretence of confidence and friendship, all those details
about where they had been, and what they had done and seen, and how
often they had said, &ldquo;O!&nbsp; If we had only darling little Kitty
here!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here indeed!&nbsp; I dare say!&nbsp; When they came
back after the holidays, they were used to being received by Kitty,
and to saying that coming to Kitty was like coming to another home.&nbsp;
Very well then, why did they go away?&nbsp; If the meant it, why did
they go away?&nbsp; Let them answer that.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t
mean it, and couldn&rsquo;t answer that, and they didn&rsquo;t tell
the truth, and people who didn&rsquo;t tell the truth were hateful.&nbsp;
When they came back next time, they should be received in a new manner;
they should be avoided and shunned.</p>
<p>And there, the while she sat all alone revolving how ill she was
used, and how much better she was than the people who were not alone,
the wedding breakfast was going on: no question of it!&nbsp; With a
nasty great bride-cake, and with those ridiculous orange-flowers, and
with that conceited bride, and that hideous bridegroom, and those heartless
bridesmaids, and Miss Pupford stuck up at the table!&nbsp; They thought
they were enjoying themselves, but it would come home to them one day
to have thought so.&nbsp; They would all be dead in a few years, let
them enjoy themselves ever so much.&nbsp; It was a religious comfort
to know that.</p>
<p>It was such a comfort to know it, that little Miss Kitty Kimmeens
suddenly sprang from the chair in which she had been musing in a corner,
and cried out, &ldquo;O those envious thoughts are not mine, O this
wicked creature isn&rsquo;t me!&nbsp; Help me, somebody!&nbsp; I go
wrong, alone by my weak self!&nbsp; Help me, anybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Miss Kimmeens is not a professed philosopher, sir,&rdquo;
said Mr. Traveller, presenting her at the barred window, and smoothing
her shining hair, &ldquo;but I apprehend there was some tincture of
philosophy in her words, and in the prompt action with which she followed
them.&nbsp; That action was, to emerge from her unnatural solitude,
and look abroad for wholesome sympathy, to bestow and to receive.&nbsp;
Her footsteps strayed to this gate, bringing her here by chance, as
an apposite contrast to you.&nbsp; The child came out, sir.&nbsp; If
you have the wisdom to learn from a child (but I doubt it, for that
requires more wisdom than one in your condition would seem to possess),
you cannot do better than imitate the child, and come out too&mdash;from
that very demoralising hutch of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;PICKING UP THE TINKER</h2>
<p>It was now sunset.&nbsp; The Hermit had betaken himself to his bed
of cinders half an hour ago, and lying on it in his blanket and skewer
with his back to the window, took not the smallest heed of the appeal
addressed to him.</p>
<p>All that had been said for the last two hours, had been said to a
tinkling accompaniment performed by the Tinker, who had got to work
upon some villager&rsquo;s pot or kettle, and was working briskly outside.&nbsp;
This music still continuing, seemed to put it into Mr. Traveller&rsquo;s
mind to have another word or two with the Tinker.&nbsp; So, holding
Miss Kimmeens (with whom he was now on the most friendly terms) by the
hand, he went out at the gate to where the Tinker was seated at his
work on the patch of grass on the opposite side of the road, with his
wallet of tools open before him, and his little fire smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you employed,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to <i>be</i> employed,&rdquo; returned the Tinker,
looking up as he put the finishing touches to his job.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
why are you glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a lazy fellow when I saw you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only disgusted,&rdquo; said the Tinker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean with the fine weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the fine weather?&rdquo; repeated the Tinker, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me you were not particular as to weather, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp; How should such as me get on, if we <i>was</i>
particular as to weather?&nbsp; We must take it as it comes, and make
the best of it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something good in all weathers.&nbsp;
If it don&rsquo;t happen to be good for my work to-day, it&rsquo;s good
for some other man&rsquo;s to-day, and will come round to me to-morrow.&nbsp;
We must all live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray shake hands,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, sir,&rdquo; was the Tinker&rsquo;s caution, as
he reached up his hand in surprise; &ldquo;the black comes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have been for several hours among other black that does not come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are speaking of Tom in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said the Tinker, blowing the dust off his
job: which was finished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it enough to disgust
a pig, if he could give his mind to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he could give his mind to it,&rdquo; returned the other,
smiling, &ldquo;the probability is that he wouldn&rsquo;t be a pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you clench the nail,&rdquo; returned the Tinker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to be said for Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly nothing you mean, sir,&rdquo; said the Tinker, as he
put away his tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A better answer, and (I freely acknowledge) my meaning.&nbsp;
I infer that he was the cause of your disgust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look&rsquo;ee here, sir,&rdquo; said the Tinker, rising
to his feet, and wiping his face on the corner of his black apron energetically;
&ldquo;I leave you to judge!&mdash;I ask you!&mdash;Last night I has
a job that needs to be done in the night, and I works all night.&nbsp;
Well, there&rsquo;s nothing in that.&nbsp; But this morning I comes
along this road here, looking for a sunny and soft spot to sleep in,
and I sees this desolation and ruination.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lived myself
in desolation and ruination; I knows many a fellow-creetur that&rsquo;s
forced to live life long in desolation and ruination; and I sits me
down and takes pity on it, as I casts my eyes about.&nbsp; Then comes
up the long-winded one as I told you of, from that gate, and spins himself
out like a silkworm concerning the Donkey (if my Donkey at home will
excuse me) as has made it all&mdash;made it of his own choice!&nbsp;
And tells me, if you please, of his likewise choosing to go ragged and
naked, and grimy&mdash;maskerading, mountebanking, in what is the real
hard lot of thousands and thousands!&nbsp; Why, then I say it&rsquo;s
a unbearable and nonsensical piece of inconsistency, and I&rsquo;m disgusted.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m ashamed and disgusted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would come and look at him,&rdquo; said Mr. Traveller,
clapping the Tinker on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, sir,&rdquo; he rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
a going to flatter him up by looking at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he is asleep?&rdquo; asked the Tinker, with an
unwilling air, as he shouldered his wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll look at him for a quarter of a minute,&rdquo;
said the Tinker, &ldquo;since you so much wish it; but not a moment
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all three went back across the road; and, through the barred
window, by the dying glow of the sunset coming in at the gate&mdash;which
the child held open for its admission&mdash;he could be pretty clearly
discerned lying on his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the Tinker, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s worse
than I thought him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Traveller then whispered in few words what he had done since
morning; and asked the Tinker what he thought of that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; returned the Tinker, as he turned from the
window, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve wasted a day on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too; though not, I hope, upon myself.&nbsp; Do
you happen to be going anywhere near the Peal of Bells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my direct way, sir,&rdquo; said the Tinker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I invite you to supper there.&nbsp; And as I learn from this
young lady that she goes some three-quarters of a mile in the same direction,
we will drop her on the road, and we will spare time to keep her company
at her garden gate until her own Bella comes home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Mr. Traveller, and the child, and the Tinker, went along very
amicably in the sweet-scented evening; and the moral with which the
Tinker dismissed the subject was, that he said in his trade that metal
that rotted for want of use, had better be left to rot, and couldn&rsquo;t
rot too soon, considering how much true metal rotted from over-use and
hard service.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
