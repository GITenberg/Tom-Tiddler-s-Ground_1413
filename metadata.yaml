description: '"And why Tom Tiddler''s ground?" said the Traveller. "Because he scatters
  halfpence to Tramps and such-like," returned the Landlord, "and of course they pick
  ''em up. And this being done on his own land (which it IS his own land, you observe,
  and were his family''s before him), why it is but regarding the halfpence as gold
  and silver, and turning the ownership of the property a bit round your finger, and
  there you have the name of the children''s game complete. And it''s appropriate
  too," said the Landlord, with his favourite action of stooping a little, to look
  across the table out of window at vacancy, under the window-blind which was half
  drawn down. "Leastwise it has been so considered by many gentlemen which have partook
  of chops and tea in the present humble parlour."  The Traveller was partaking of
  chops and tea in the present humble parlour, and the Landlord''s shot was fired
  obliquely at him. "And you call him a Hermit?" said the Traveller.'
